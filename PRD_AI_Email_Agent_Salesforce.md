# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Email Agent for Salesforce

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered email triage and response agent** integrated with Salesforce.  
The agent will:
- Classify incoming customer responses to campaign emails.
- Update Salesforce records accordingly.
- Send tailored follow-up responses when appropriate.

This solution will **reduce manual workload**, **improve lead management**, and **enhance engagement** with prospects.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Automate classification of incoming email replies: **Not Interested**, **Maybe Interested**, **Interested**.
- Update Salesforce lead/contact records with campaign engagement status.
- Generate and send personalized follow-up emails for **Maybe Interested** and **Interested** leads.
- Notify sales reps when high-priority **Interested** replies are received.
- Maintain clean campaign lists by removing **Not Interested** leads from active campaigns.

---

## 3. Scope
### In Scope:
- Email integration (IMAP/POP or API) for monitoring replies.
- LLM-powered classification engine for analyzing responses.
- Salesforce REST API integration for updating lead/contact fields and creating tasks.
- Automated response drafting and sending.
- Notifications for high-priority leads via email or task creation.

### Out of Scope (Phase 1):
- Advanced analytics dashboards.
- Multi-channel integration (SMS, social media).
- Complex campaign journey automation (covered in later phases).

---

## 4. Functional Requirements
- The system must classify replies into one of three categories: **Not Interested**, **Maybe Interested**, **Interested**.
- The system must update Salesforce with a new custom field: **`Campaign Status`** for each lead/contact.
- The system must generate context-aware responses using AI for **Maybe** and **Interested** replies.
- The system must remove **Not Interested** leads from active campaign sequences but retain them in Salesforce.
- The system must notify sales reps of **Interested** replies via email or Salesforce task creation.

---

## 5. Technical Architecture
- **Email Integration:** IMAP/POP3 or Gmail/Outlook API.  
- **AI Layer:** LLM for classification and response generation (OpenAI or Anthropic).  
- **Salesforce Integration:** REST API for updating lead/contact records and creating tasks.  
- **Notification Layer:** Automated email or Salesforce task creation.  
- **Hosting:** Python backend (FastAPI) on Render/AWS Lambda for lightweight operations.

---

## 6. Success Metrics
- **90%+ classification accuracy** for incoming replies.  
- **Reduction of manual triage workload by 70%.**  
- **Average response time for Interested leads reduced to under 1 hour.**  
- **Improved engagement metrics** (open and reply rates) for follow-up responses.

---

## 7. Proposed Timeline
| Phase | Timeline      | Key Deliverables |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Weeks 1–2  | Requirements gathering, Salesforce field setup, email integration |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 3–4  | AI classification model setup and testing |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 5–6  | Salesforce API integration, follow-up template library creation |
| **Phase 4** | Weeks 7–8  | Notifications setup, QA, and pilot launch |

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation
- **Misclassification of responses** – Mitigate with human-in-the-loop review for initial rollout.  
- **API rate limits (Salesforce or email)** – Implement batching and retry mechanisms.  
- **Deliverability concerns** – Use trusted sending domains and proper authentication (SPF/DKIM).
